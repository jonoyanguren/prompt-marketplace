    content: `
        <p>Flowbite is an open-source library of interactive components built on top of Tailwind CSS including buttons, dropdowns, modals, navbars, and more.</p>

    content: `
        <p>Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software so everything you see in the library has a design equivalent in our Figma file.</p>
        <p>Check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/figma/" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">Figma design system</a> based on the utility classes from Tailwind CSS and components from Flowbite.</p>

    title: "What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?",
    content: `
        <p>The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.</p>
        <p>However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.</p>
